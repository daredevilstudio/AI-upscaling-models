# Advanced AI Upscaling Models
This repository contains a suite of my high-performance AI models for photorealistic upscaling and restoration. Each model, built on architectures including SwinIR, ESRGAN, RealPLKSR and others, has been trained on my own dataset: a library of over 11,000 hand-selected and versatile real-world HD images of exceptional quality and information density. The result of this several months-long dataset curation effort is a set of models that excel at rendering authentic textures and objects (skin, fabric, grit) and intelligently handling a wide variety of image degradations.
