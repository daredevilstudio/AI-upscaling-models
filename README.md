# Advanced AI Restoration Models
This repository contains a suite of high-performance AI models for photorealistic upscaling and restoration. Each model, built on architectures including SwinIR, ESRGAN, RealPLKSR and others, has been meticulously trained on my own dataset: a library of over 12,000 hand-selected, high-complexity real-world images. The result of this months-long dataset curation effort is a set of models that excel at rendering authentic textures (skin, fabric, grit) and intelligently handling a wide variety of image degradation.
