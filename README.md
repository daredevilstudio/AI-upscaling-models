# Advanced AI Upscaling & Restoration Models
This repository contains a suite of my high-performance AI models for photorealistic upscaling and restoration. Each model, built on architectures including [SwinIR](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR), [ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN), [RealPLKSR](https://github.com/dslisleedh/PLKSR) and others, has been trained on my own dataset: a library of over 11,000 hand-selected and versatile real-world HD images of exceptional quality and information density. The result of this several months-long dataset curation effort is a set of models that excel at rendering authentic textures and objects (skin, fabric, grit) and intelligently handling a wide variety of image degradations. Please keep in mind that this repo will be periodically updated with new and improved models as the time goes by. My dataset will also continue to grow making further models even more versatile and intelligent.
