# AI-upscaling-models
My manually-trained AI models for photorealistic image upscaling and restoration. Built on ESRGAN, SwinIR, RealPLKSR and other architectures and trained on a fully custom high-end dataset (12,000+ real-world HD images) which took several months to compile. Models excel at restoring authentic textures (skin, fabric, grit) and handle various types of degradation.
