# AI-upscaling-models
AI models for photorealistic image upscaling and restoration. Built on ESRGAN, SwinIR, RealPLKSR and other architectures and trained on a manually curated high-end dataset (12,000+ real-world HD images). Models excel at restoring authentic textures (skin, fabric, grit) and handle various types of degradation.
