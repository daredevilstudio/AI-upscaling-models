# AI Upscaling Models
My manually-trained AI models for photorealistic image upscaling and restoration. Built on SwinIR, ESRGAN, RealPLKSR and other architectures and trained on a fully custom high-end dataset (12,000+ real-world HD images), which took several months to compile. Models excel at restoring authentic textures (skin, fabric, grit) and handle various types of degradation.
